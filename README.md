# Wifi-tools 

This is just a collection of scripts I use to interface with the wifi 
hardware of my linux machine. It may be useful to some people, e.g., 
people using a raspberry pi without a desktop environement. 

However, this tools you can probably find somewhere else better programmed. 

## Installation 

To install (locally) you must have a *bin* folder in you home directory.
